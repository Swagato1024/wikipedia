                  West Bengal Bengali: Poshchim Bongo, is a state in the eastern
                  portion of India. It is situated along the Bay of Bengal,
                  along with a population of over 91 million inhabitants within
                  an area of 88,752 km2. West Bengal is the fourth-most populous
                  and thirteenth-largest state by area in India, as well as the
                  eighth-most populous country subdivision of the world. As a
                  part of the Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent, it
                  borders Bangladesh in the east, and Nepal and Bhutan in the
                  north. It also borders the Indian states of Jharkhand, Odisha,
                  Bihar, Sikkim and Assam. The state capital is Kolkata, the
                  third-largest metropolis, and seventh largest city by
                  population in India. West Bengal includes the Darjeeling
                  Himalayan hill region, the Ganges delta, the Rarh region, the
                  coastal Sundarbans and the Bay of Bengal. The state's main
                  ethnic group are the Bengalis, with the Bengali Hindus forming
                  the demographic majority. The area's early history featured a
                  succession of Indian empires, internal squabbling, and a
                  tussle between Hinduism and Buddhism for dominance. Ancient
                  Bengal was the site of several major Janapadas, while the
                  earliest cities date back to the Vedic period. The region was
                  part of several ancient pan−Indian empires, including the
                  Vangas, Mauryans, and the Guptas. The citadel of Gauḍa served
                  as the capital of the Gauḍa Kingdom, the Pala Empire, and the
                  Sena Empire. Islam was introduced through trade with the
                  Abbasid Caliphate, but following the Ghurid conquests led by
                  Bakhtiyar Khalji and the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate,
                  the Muslim faith spread across the entire Bengal region.
                  During the Bengal Sultanate, the territory was a major trading
                  nation in the world, and was often referred by the Europeans
                  as the "richest country to trade with". It was absorbed into
                  the Mughal Empire in 1576. Simultaneously, some parts of the
                  region were ruled by several Hindu states, and Baro-Bhuyan
                  landlords, and part of it was briefly overrun by the Suri
                  Empire. Following the death of Emperor Aurangzeb in the early
                  1700s, the proto-industrialised Mughal Bengal became a
                  semi-independent state under the Nawabs of Bengal, and showed
                  signs of the first Industrial revolution.

                  The region was a hotbed of the Indian independence movement
                  and has remained one of India's great artistic and
                  intellectual centres.[14] Following widespread religious
                  violence, the Bengal Legislative Council and the Bengal
                  Legislative Assembly voted on the Partition of Bengal in 1947
                  along religious lines into two independent dominions: West
                  Bengal, a Hindu-majority Indian state, and East Bengal, a
                  Muslim-majority province of Pakistan which later became the
                  independent Bangladesh. The early and prolonged exposure to
                  British administration resulted in an expansion of Western
                  education, culminating in developments in science,
                  institutional education, and social reforms in the region,
                  including what became known as the Bengali Renaissance.
                  Several regional and pan−Indian empires throughout Bengal's
                  history have shaped its culture, cuisine, and architecture.

                  Post-Indian independence, as a welfare state, West Bengal's
                  economy is based on agricultural production and small and
                  medium-sized enterprises.[15] The state's cultural heritage,
                  besides varied folk traditions, ranges from stalwarts in
                  literature including Nobel-laureate Rabindranath Tagore to
                  scores of musicians, film-makers and artists. For several
                  decades, the state underwent political violence and economic
                  stagnation before it rebounded In 2023–24, the economy of West
                  Bengal is the sixth-largest state economy in India with a
                  gross state domestic product (GSDP) of ₹17.19 lakh crore
                  (US$220 billion),[4] and has the country's 20th-highest GSDP
                  per capita of ₹121,267 (US$1,500).[5] Despite being one of the
                  fastest-growing major economies, West Bengal has struggled to
                  attract foreign direct investment due to adverse land
                  acquisition policies, poor infrastructure, and red
                  tape.[17][18]

                  The etymology of Bangladesh ("Bengali Country") can be traced
                  to the early 20th century, when Bengali patriotic songs, such
                  as Namo Namo Namo Bangladesh Momo by Kazi Nazrul Islam and
                  Aaji Bangladesher Hridoy by Rabindranath Tagore, used the
                  term.[35] The term Bangladesh was often written as two words,
                  Bangla Desh, in the past. Starting in the 1950s, Bengali
                  nationalists used the term in political rallies in East
                  Pakistan. The term Bangla is a major name for both the Bengal
                  region and the Bengali language. The origins of the term
                  Bangla are unclear, with theories pointing to a Bronze Age
                  proto-Dravidian tribe,[36] and the Iron Age Vanga Kingdom.[37]
                  The earliest known usage of the term is the Nesari plate in
                  805 AD. The term Vangala Desa is found in 11th-century South
                  Indian records.[38][39] The term gained official status during
                  the Sultanate of Bengal in the 14th century.[40][41]
                  Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah proclaimed himself as the first "Shah of
                  Bangala" in 1342.[40] The word Bangāl became the most common
                  name for the region during the Islamic period
                </p>

                <p>
                  In 2011 the Government of West Bengal proposed a change in the
                  official name of the state to Paschim Banga (Bengali:
                  পশ্চিমবঙ্গ Pôshchimbônggô).[27] This is the native name of the
                  state, literally meaning "western Bengal" in the native
                  Bengali language. In August 2016 the West Bengal Legislative
                  Assembly passed another resolution to change the name of West
                  Bengal to "Bengal" in English and "Bangla" in Bengali. Despite
                  the Trinamool Congress government's efforts to forge a
                  consensus on the name change resolution, the Indian National
                  Congress, the Left Front and the Bharatiya Janata Party
                  opposed the resolution.[28] However, the central government
                  has turned down the proposal maintaining the state should have
                  one single name for all languages instead of three and it
                  should not be the same as that of any other territory
                  (pointing out that the name 'Bangla' may create confusion with
                  neighbouring Bangladesh)

                  Stone Age tools dating back 20,000 years have been excavated
                  in the state, showing human occupation 8,000 years earlier
                  than scholars had thought.[31] According to the Indian epic
                  Mahabharata the region was part of the Vanga Kingdom.[32]
                  Several Vedic realms were present in the Bengal region,
                  including Vanga, Rarh, Pundravardhana and the Suhma Kingdom.
                  One of the earliest foreign references to Bengal is a mention
                  by the Ancient Greeks around 100 BCE of a land named
                  Gangaridai located at the mouths of the Ganges.[33] Bengal had
                  overseas trade relations with Suvarnabhumi (Burma, Lower
                  Thailand, the Lower Malay Peninsula and Sumatra).[34]
                  According to the Sri Lankan chronicle Mahavamsa, Prince Vijaya
                  (c. 543 – c. 505 BCE), a Vanga Kingdom prince, conquered Lanka
                  (modern-day Sri Lanka) and named the country Sinhala Kingdom
